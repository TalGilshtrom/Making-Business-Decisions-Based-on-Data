# Making-Business-Decisions-Based-on-Data
This project is a part of Practicum100-Masterschool Data Analyst course's real data-based projects.
In this project i am analysing an AB test results, and trying to declare a winning group and decide whether to stop or continue the test.
I am interpreting the resulting graphs, calculating statistical significance, and drawing a data-based conclusion.

<b> The repository contains: </b>

<ul>
<li> Notebook with hypotheses that may help boost revenue: Online store - prioritize hypotheses, launch an AB test, analyze results.ipynb </li>
<li> dataset: hypotheses_us.csv </li>
<li> dataset: orders_us.csv </li>
<li> dataset: visits_us.csv </li>

</ul>
